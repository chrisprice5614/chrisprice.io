                    <h1>Nektar Impact GX49</h1>
                    <p>When I was younger, I composed music in the worst way possible. I used my hand, dragged the mouse to get the note-length I wanted, dragged the mouse onto the staff, and then clicked. For any of you who have tried to engrave with such method, you know how much it sucks. I was unaware that there were other ways of using composition software. My Freshman year of college is when I finally got a midi keyboard. 24 keys were all I had to work with. I want to emphasize the <b>freedom</b> I gained from using 49 keys. My speed of composition doubled, and my harmonic vocabulary exploded. This low-cost piece of technology was well worth the investment. It's been my composition companion for years, and I hope for it to be yours as well.</p>

                    <h1>Yamaha Trombone</h1>
                    <p>Let me tell you a story. My Christmas list when I was 16 consisted of a brand new trombone. I got a Mendini trombone from amazon. Imagine this, you get a brand new trombone, open up the case, piece together the instrument, and then play your first note on it. You expect a tone you're used to, but instead get the dirtiest, gross beam of sound your ears have ever witnessed. Imagine my shock when I learned that a trombone costing only a few bucks would sound like that. I was of course grateful for the instrument and used it for many years. Let me tell you, the difference that happens when you get yourself a nice trombone that actually sounds good is huge. I highly highly recommend you get yourself a better trombone. I've been using this one for years and it has never let me down.</p>

                    <h1>Bach 5G Mouthpiece</h1>
                    <p>Other than having internet with your trombone, the 5G mouthpiece will give you an amazing tone. When my trombone lesson professor first recommended a big mouthpiece like this I didn't think I'd be able to play any high notes. But alas, to my surprise, I was able to hit all sorts of higher notes with amazing tone quality. Gone were the days of laser tone. Eventually I found it even easier to hit higher notes with this mouthpiece. Trust me, this mouthpiece has helped me in so many ways.</p>

                    <h1>Finale</h1>
                    <p>Not really gear, but definitely something that has been by my side since I was 11. When I got my first instrument, the cello, I received a packet on how to play the cello that came with a CD. The CD included the Devil's spawn, Smart-Music, as well as finale notepad. I used the latter program over and over once I learned that it can be used to write music. To this day I use finale, and I've mastered the art of engraving with it. I love it for its versatility, playback options, and light weight. I've tried the other big name composition software and just can't get behind them like I can with finale.</p>

                    <h1>Behringer Pre-Amp</h1>
                    <p>A good preamp is literally a pain to find. I have 4, 3 of them suck, and 2 of those sucky ones are <i>very</i> overpriced. After lots of digging I found the U-Phoria preamp and it's been wonderful for me! What exactly do I use this pre-amp for? It's the backbone of all my recording. I plug my microphone into the pre-amp, then plug it into my PC, letting me record everything. The only downside is that there's some fuzz that occurs randomly, but a simple unplug then replug will fix it. It has both a quarter inch input and a mic cable input. It's mono, but honestly that's all I need for what I do. If you're looking for stereo they have that option as well in the link!</p>
