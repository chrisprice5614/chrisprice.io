            <h4>Chris</h4>
            <p>
                Christian Price (or "Chris" as he usually goes by) is a computer scientist, composer and artist. Since the young age of 8, Chris has been fascinated with the idea of
                technology and computers, stemming from his enjoyment of playing video games. Video game development began as a hobby when he first programmed a "pac-man-esque" game
                at home while still only 8. Over the years, he refined his craft by developing 3D Multiplayer First Person Shooter games. Also while in middle school, Chris began learning
                piano and cello. Music and programming would eventually combine in college, where he would create digital <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_synthesizer">
                soft-synths</a> and music writing AI.

            <h4>VoxPrincipalis</h4>
            <p>
                VoxPrincipalis is a YouTube channel created by Chris. The aim of the channel was to produce content related to Rainbow Six: Seige. As of right now, the channel
                hasn't been updated much, with the latest video uploaded in November of 2022. There are plans to continue content on the channel, but there may be a different
                aim when it comes to content. There's also a TikTok account of the same name with similar content.
