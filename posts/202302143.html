            <h2>Simply Put</h2>
            <p>
                Simplex noise is a type of noise function that can be used to generate random patterns that have certain desirable properties. It was invented by Ken Perlin in the early 2000s and has since become a popular tool in computer graphics and other fields. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The basic idea behind simplex noise is to create a set of random values that are smoothly varying across a region of space. Imagine that you want to create a map of a landscape, but you don't want it to look too uniform or repetitive. One way to do this would be to use simplex noise to generate a random height value at each point in the map, based on its location.
            </p>

            <div class="caption">One of the many uses of simplex noise</div>
            <h2>Cookbook</h2>
            <p>
                To generate simplex noise, you start by dividing the space into a set of regular grid cells. For example, you might divide the space into a set of square cells, each of which is one unit wide and tall. At the center of each cell, you generate a random n-dimensional vector. In 2D, this vector would have two components, one for the x direction and one for the y direction.
            </p>
            <p>
                Next, you define a set of "corner points" for each cell. These are the points where the edges of the cell intersect with the edges of neighboring cells. For example, in 2D, a square cell would have four corner points, one at each vertex. You can calculate the distance from each corner point to the center of the cell, and use this distance to weight the contribution of the corresponding random vector.
            </p>

            <h2>Getting the value</h2>
            <p>
                To generate a value at a given point in space, you first find the cell that contains that point. You can then calculate the distance from the point to each of the corner points of the cell. To do this, you subtract the coordinates of the point from the coordinates of each corner point. You can then use these distances to weight the contribution of the corresponding random vectors.
            </p>
            <p>
                The final step is to interpolate between the values of the random vectors at the corner points. There are many ways to do this, but one common method is to use a smooth function that varies smoothly from 0 to 1 as the distance from one corner point to the target point increases. One such function is the "quintic" polynomial function, which looks like a smooth curve with a gentle slope.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can then take a weighted average of the values of the random vectors at the corner points, using the weights calculated from the distances to each point. The result is a smoothly varying value that varies across the space in a random pattern. This pattern has certain desirable properties, such as being smooth and continuous across neighboring points.
            </p>
            <p>
                Simplex noise is a powerful tool that can be used in many different applications. For example, it can be used to generate realistic textures for 3D models, to generate terrain for video games, or to create random art. It is a complex concept, but hopefully this explanation has helped to demystify it a bit!
