            <h2>What is Digital Audio Synthesis?
            </h2>
            <p>
                You may have heard the term <i>analog</i> at one point in your life. The word itself refers to a continuous signal, such as voltage, position or amplitude. Each of those
                variables are very important when talking about synthesizers and digital audio synthesis. We all know that sound is vibration, and that speakers make sound by creating
                vibration. Speakers receive analog data from the device they're connected to, and then convert that voltage into a position. The speaker will move back if the voltage is low,
                and out if the voltage is high. This back and forth movement is what ultimately creates sound from the speaker.
            </p>
            <h2>Sample Rate</h2>
            <p>
                The standard for speakers is to be able to move 44,100 times in one second. This number wasn't arbitrarily chosen, but rather was decided based on human hearing.
                Humans can hear roughly 22,000 changes in movement per second, so if we were to double this amount and slightly increase it just in case some data is lost, humans
                will be able to hear the speaker's audio very clearly.
            </p>
            <p>
                This number, 44,100, is known as the sample rate. Some speakers can produce a higher sample rate while others can't produce a sample rate higher than 2,000. The sample
                rate is named as such because each position of the speaker is known as a <span class="green">sample</span>, not to be confused with the DJ term "sampling." A sample
                rate of 44,100 means that the speaker can move 44,100 times in one second. The higher the sample rate, the smoother the audio sound. Think of it as the X-Axis of audio.
            </p>

            <div class="caption">The number of samples in one second is the sample rate. One single sample is one position of the speaker.</div>
            <h2>Bit Depth</h2>
            <p>
                For those of you who are here with a computer science background, you may know that 32 bit integers can store more data than 16 bit integers. The exact same applies
                to digital audio synthesis. The bit depth of a speaker or audio file is how smooth the amplitude of the audio can be. Think of it as the Y axis of the audio.
            </p>
            <img src="/media/202302132/02.png" style="display: block; width: 75%; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;">
            <div class="caption">With a small bit depth, the speaker doesn't have a good range to smoothly move back and forth.</div>
            <p>
                Low bit depth and sample rate is what gives old computer audio its unique computery sound. If you were to "crush" your audio, you'd be lowering the bit depth and
                sample rate. Each number you increase the bit depth will increase the sound quality by a power of two, meaning a bit depth difference of 3 to 4 is extremely tiny
                compared to the difference between 7 to 8.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Generating Audio</h2>
            <p>
                Now that we have the basics of bit depths and sample rates, we can understand how audio itself is generated. First, know your bit depth and your sample rate. If
                you have a sample rate of 44,100 it's easy to get an A with tuning of 440. We'll see why in a second. With your sample rate, you need to know what the highest value
                is. If you're sample rate is 8, the highest value is one less than 2^8, which is 255. Meaning, if you generate a sine wave that goes betwen 0 and 255 440 times, you
                can create a sine wave with the sound of an A 440.
            </p>
            <p>
                Getting the amplitude of the sine wave is the easy part. In most programming languages, sine goes between -1 and 1. Most programming languages also offer a
                degree version of sine, which will help us out a lot. So our value can be 122+(dsine(x)*122), where 122 is our middle ground and x is our angle. Now we need to
                create a nice x angle. Let's let t be the time, where t is continuously moving with the speed of the sample rate. So t will start at 0, move to 44,100 in the first
                second, and then 88,200 in the second second. Our current x function is x = t, so we need to modify the function to have a rotation 440 times a second.
            </p>
            <p>
                With x = t, there are 122.5 cycles per second, making the sound of a slightly flat B2. To find what we need to divide t by to get 440 cycles per second (or hertz <i>hz</i>)
                we divide 440 by 122.5, giving us 3.5918. In our function we modify it to be x = t/3.5918. Now, the sound we get is a beautiful A=440 sine wave.
            </p>
            <p>
                More advanced tutorials will be released on how to make more sounds with math.
