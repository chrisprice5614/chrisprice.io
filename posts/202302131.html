            <h2>A New Corps</h2>
            <p>
                Over the summer, a call was received inquiring about drum corps music. The call was made by a close friend of mine, <spawn class="green">Austin Moldenhauer</spawn>,
                whom I was very excited to hear from. Moldenhauer and I were bus buddies during the 2018 season of the Tri-Cities Columbians. A bond was made that only bus buddies could
                ever have. I let Moldenhauer know that I would love to arrange some drum corps music, but what made me more excited was hearing about him starting a new Drum and Bugle
                Corps.
            </p>
            <p>
                Drum Corps in the Gem State has been considered for a very long time, due to the high amount of student musicians in the area. Before Gems were created, the nearest Corps
                were 6 hours of driving away, either to the Tri-Cities for the Columbians or to Salt Lake city for Battalion. Having the Boise Gems is a blessing to nearby musicians.
                Armada Corps, a winter guard group also based in Boise Idaho, full of eager students who want to march more Drum Corps now have a new nearby opportunity.

            <h2>Making the Right Show</h2>
            <p>
                Drum corps would not exist if it wasn't for the music. The music is what ultimately decides the tone, style and theme of
                the show. Although I can't say what the source music of the show is just yet, I can say that the piece has to do with being timeless, enduring and strong. The name
                of the Gems' inagural show, <i>Esto Perpetua</i> was chosen by the show designers specifically to let the world know that they will continue on for years to come.
            </p>
            <p>
                Esto Perpetua also has a double meaning being the motto of the state of Idaho. "Be Eternal" is the literal translation. The Gems not only want a show that will
                let their corps endure, but they also want a show that will match the spirit of the state they were founded in.
            </p>

            <h2>Impressive Camps</h2>
            <p>
                I luckily had the privilege of not only being the arranger, but also a member of the ensemble. The Boise Gems are currently open to any age. During the first camp,
                many skilled musicians and color guard performers arrived and were excited to get started with the corps. While in the brass block of the first camp, I was blown away at how well
                the corps was sounding without ever having played together before.
            </p>
            <p>
                Most people that have either done marching band or drum corps can always talk about how well the sense of community was felt throughout their ensemble. Within the first
                camp, others and myself felt that close sense of community. I want to give a public thank you to Austin Moldenhauer, for putting together this amazing organization.
            </p>
            <h1 class="important">Important Message To All: Be a Gem</h1>
            <p>
                There's still plenty of time to become a Gem and join the amazing experience. The tour cost is incredibly low, being only $300. People as far away as Spokane are making
                the 7 hour drive to each camp to participate. Please check out their website linked <a href="https://www.boisegems.org/Contact-or-Donate.html" target="_blank">here</a>
                for more information about joining.
